    A screenshot costs a vision model roughly 1,600 to 4,800 image tokens. This
    returns the same screen as a few hundred tokens of text in reading order,
    with a bounding box per line, so you can see what is on screen and where to
    click without spending them. Omit image_path to capture the current monitor.

    detail is "lines" (default: text plus one box per line), "text" (cheapest,
    reading order only), or "words" (a box per word — on a dense screen this can
    cost MORE tokens than the screenshot did, and the reply says so when it has).

    Read these limits before relying on it. The text comes from Tesseract OCR, so
    it is a best-effort transcription and not a user-interface tree: it cannot
    report widget types, enabled or checked state, focus, scroll position, or
    anything off-screen, and it misreads small or low-contrast text. **If the
    target is a web page, use Playwright's accessibility tree instead** — that is
    already structured text, it is exact, it includes content scrolled out of
    view, and it costs no model tokens to produce. This tool is for surfaces with
    no such tree: native desktop applications, remote desktops, canvas and WebGL,
