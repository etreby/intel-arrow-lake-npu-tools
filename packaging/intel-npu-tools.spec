# Built and installed on both Fedora and openSUSE Tumbleweed on every push, in
# containers, by the install-fedora and install-opensuse jobs. Each builds the
# spec on the distribution it targets — which is the only way the %if below is
# evaluated both ways — installs the result, checks that every dependency name
# it declares resolves there, and checks the installed tree.
#
# Enterprise Linux is still unverified: it needs EPEL for ffmpeg-free and
# tesseract, and nothing here has been run against it.
#
# Installs the same tree as the Debian and Arch packages by calling the shared
# staging script, so the three cannot drift apart.
#
# The models and the OpenVINO runtime are deliberately absent: they are large,
# they are redistributed under their own licences, and OpenVINO is not in the
# distribution archives. Each user runs intel-npu-tools-setup once, which is
# also why nothing here touches the network — a maintainer script must not.
#
# Build with:
#   rpmbuild -bb packaging/intel-npu-tools.spec \
#            --define "_sourcedir $PWD" --define "_projectdir $PWD"

# Dependency names differ between the RPM distributions, so they are selected

# Both sets are now checked by name on the distribution they are for, which is

# data by the three-letter code, and a Recommends that matches nothing is

%description
Makes the integrated Intel AI Boost NPU in Arrow Lake processors useful on
Linux. Provides private semantic search, local Whisper transcription,
screenshot text extraction, a control panel, and an MCP server that AI agents
can call to keep bulk text out of their context window.

The models and the OpenVINO runtime are not included, because they are large
and are redistributed under their own licences. Run intel-npu-tools-setup once
as your own user to create the environment and download them.
